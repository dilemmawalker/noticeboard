# BPIT-NoticeBot
This bot scrapes my college website (http://www.bpitindia.com) at a frequency of every 15 minutes and checks for new Notices & Announcements. If there's any new Update from my college side, this bot scrapes that from there and post on various social media platform (currently only on Facebook) for better reachment of that among students, faculties and various concerned management authorities. 

# Inspiration for this bot
I got inspiration for this bot, from my past experiences when I missed a deadline to submit my practical records to the concerned department only because of not regularly checking my college website for updates and announcements.
So, by learning from this incident and making sure that such event doesn't happen again with any of my fellow college mates, I tried to make this bot

# Additional Features
This bot has an Activity Monitor(glances) through which user has the full information about the bot, like how much CPU resource currently its using, how much RAM has been allocated to the bot, how much network bandwidth it's consuming and many other useful information.
